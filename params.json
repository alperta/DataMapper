Useful for fast database insertion from POPO\r\nand getting POPO from array fetched from database.\r\n\r\nRedefineLab DataMapper is provided with a service provider for Silex framework.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nRedefineLab DataMapper use PHP Composer.\r\nUpdate your composer.json file like so :\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"minimum-stability\": \"dev\",\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"redefinelab/datamapper\" : \"dev-master\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore info : http://getcomposer.org\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPlease see src/DataMapper.php for the API.\r\n\r\nWhen converting an object to an array, RedefineLab DataMapper will fetch\r\nall of the object public methods beginning with 'get'. It is adviced to use\r\ncamel case method names. In that case, any upper case character or number\r\nencountered will be mapped to an underscore followed by the lower case\r\ncharacter (or number), to comply with SQL naming conventions.\r\nThe same mechanism applies in the reverse direction where underscore\r\nseparated column names are mapped to camel case setter names.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how methods are mapped to column names :\r\n\r\n```text\r\n// getters to column names\r\ngetProperty => property\r\ngetMyProperty => my_property\r\nget10Properties => 10_properties\r\nget10properties => 10properties\r\n\r\n// column names to setters\r\nproperty => setProperty\r\nmy_property => getMyProperty\r\n10_properties => set10Properties\r\n10properties => set10properties\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTests\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTests are run using Enhance PHP Test Framework. No complex installation\r\nrequired ! To run tests :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nphp tests/tests.php\r\n```","tagline":"Easily map objects to arrays and arrays to objects.
